**QueueBuddy Project - Join the virtual Line**
 
At queuebuddy we aim to help alleviate pressure on business on conforming Covid-19 quarantine standards by providing an easy to use solution to have customers join the line, and for the owner to delegate someone to manage that line completely virtual, by way of Web application and SMS messaging.

Our application consist of a backend REST api and WebSocket api hosted on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk to manage load balancing and factors such as HTTPS and DNS. On the front end we have created a website in Wix that where business owners can manage aspects of their store, such as store hours and who gets to manage the line.

For the future we hope to integrate work done in this capstone class into our production environment, as we only have them in our development environment thus far. Further from this we hope to add a feature that will allow store owners to setup appointments, to accommodate businesses such as hair dressers and Doctors Offices.
